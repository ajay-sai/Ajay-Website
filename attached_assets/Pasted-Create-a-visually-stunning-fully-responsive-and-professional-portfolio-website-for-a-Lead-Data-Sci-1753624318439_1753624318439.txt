About Me Section:

A more detailed section about his passion for data science, his professional journey, and his key skills.

Use a two-column layout: one for the text and one for another professional image or a relevant graphic.

Skills Section:

A visually engaging way to display his technical skills. Use icons for each skill.

Categorize skills into groups like "Programming Languages" (Python, R, SQL), "Frameworks & Libraries" (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas), "Cloud Platforms" (AWS, GCP, Azure), and "Tools" (Docker, Git, Jupyter).

Design and Technology:

Framework: Use React with functional components and hooks.

Icons: Use a popular icon library like Lucide React or Font Awesome for consistency.

Responsiveness: The website must be fully responsive and look great on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Animations: Use subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.

Instructions for the AI:

Generate the complete, self-contained React code in a single file.

Use placeholder content for project details, images, and video URLs that I can easily replace.

The code should be well-commented to explain the structure and logic.

The final output should be a professional and polished portfolio website that is ready to be deployed.
