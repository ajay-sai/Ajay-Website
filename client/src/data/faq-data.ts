    question: "What are Ajay's key achievements in AI and Machine Learning?",
    answer: "Key achievements include delivering $21M+ in cost savings, achieving 80% efficiency improvements in data processing, building ML models with 87% accuracy, and serving 4000+ users with production AI systems. Notable projects include Neo4j Knowledge-Graph RAG assistants, dynamic image generation pipelines, and LLM evaluation frameworks."
  },
  {
    question: "What technologies and tools does Ajay work with?",
    answer: "Ajay works with cutting-edge AI technologies including GPT-4, Gemini, LangChain, Neo4j, RAG systems, Vision Transformers, Stable Diffusion, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and cloud platforms like GCP, BigQuery, and Vertex AI. He specializes in Python, SQL, and building full-stack ML infrastructure."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between RAG and fine-tuning for LLMs?",
    answer: "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) retrieves relevant information from external knowledge bases to enhance LLM responses, making it ideal for dynamic, up-to-date information. Fine-tuning adjusts the model's weights on specific datasets, better for specialized domains but requires retraining. Ajay architects production RAG systems that combine both approaches for optimal results."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Ajay build production-ready AI systems?",
    answer: "Ajay focuses on end-to-end infrastructure: scalable ETL pipelines, robust data architecture (BigQuery, GCP), LLM orchestration with safety filters, comprehensive evaluation frameworks, and monitoring systems. He emphasizes reliability, speed, and measurable business impact over theoretical accuracy—building systems that work at enterprise scale, not just in notebooks."
  },
  {
    question: "What education and certifications does Ajay have?",
    answer: "Ajay holds a Master of Science in Business Statistics from the University of Maryland, College Park (Robert H. Smith School of Business, graduated 2019) and a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from SRM University (graduated 2017). He is certified as a Google Professional Data Engineer, Google Ads Professional, Certified Data Scientist (Data Camp), and Certified Data Analyst in Python (Edureka)."
